## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This part may change in the future because there are things that surely I haven't learn but what I've learn so far is to organize the **content** of a single HTML element

#### For example:

```css
.app {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  min-height: 100dvh;
}
```

> This code is suggested by [Raphael Bröderbauer](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/DigitaleWeltLibrary) and I rarely use `display: grid` but I can see now how useful this is. Upon my research `display: grid` is a ==two-dimensional layout== module that lets you work along two axes: **_horizontally_** and **_vertically_**.

> _It is best suited for creating complex layouts that require precise placement of elements._

I'll definitely use more `display: grid` to my CSS not only just `display:flex`

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This site help me to remind me how to center an object using CSS and in this part of the site, it has different ways to center an object. Very informative.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site always help to remember things, for instance in CSS. Especially if I'm not coding for a while, If I want to remember something that I have known before, I'll just go to this site. Very useful!
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss/) - This part of Scrimba when it was my first time really get into web developing, this help me understand the basics and fundamentals of HTML and CSS. High recommended for beginners, it was easy to follow and very engaging.
